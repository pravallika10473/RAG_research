In this paper, we propose a CMOS bandgap reference (BGR) and sub-BGR circuit design for nanowatt power LSIs. A BGR circuit is one of the most fundamental building blocks to perform various signal processing in LSIs. Con- ventionally, the BGR circuits require the use of a passive resistor, except for their active devices [2]. Considering the case that the BGR circuits are used in nano-ampere current levels, resistors need a large value of resistance to generate an appropriate IR voltage drop (e.g., if 0.1 V is required with a 10 nA current, the resistance should be 10 M\u03a9 for a single resistor). Therefore, the use of resistors is not practical in nanowatt power operation. In recent studies, voltage references operated at nanowatt power dissipation were presented [3]\u2013 [6].",

The current increases sharply at lower supply voltages and then levels off at higher voltages. This plot demonstrates the low-power operation of the circuit, with the current staying in the nanoampere range.\n\nThe graph in (b) shows the reference voltages generated by the bandgap reference (VREF1) and sub-bandgap reference (VREF2) circuits as a function of the supply voltage. The bandgap reference voltage remains relatively constant at around 1.09 V over the range of supply voltages, while the sub-bandgap reference voltage is lower, around 0.55 V, and also remains stable across the supply voltage range.

Con- ventionally, the BGR circuits require the use of a passive resistor, except for their active devices [2]. Considering the case that the BGR circuits are used in nano-ampere current levels, resistors need a large value of resistance to generate an appropriate IR voltage drop (e.g., if 0.1 V is required with a 10 nA current, the resistance should be 10 M\u03a9 for a single resistor). Therefore, the use of resistors is not practical in nanowatt power operation. In recent studies, voltage references operated at nanowatt power dissipation were presented [3]\u2013 [6].",

Answer: 
To compare the BG circuit specifications and architecture from the paper titled "1.2-V Supply, 100-nW, 1.09-V Bandgap and 0.7-V Supply, 52.5-nW, 0.55-V Subbandgap Reference Circuits for Nanowatt CMOS LSIs" and the [2] reference in the paper, we need to look at the details provided in both documents.

### From the paper "1.2-V Supply, 100-nW, 1.09-V Bandgap and 0.7-V Supply, 52.5-nW, 0.55-V Subbandgap Reference Circuits for Nanowatt CMOS LSIs":
- **Specifications**:
  - The bandgap reference (BGR) circuit generates a reference voltage of 1.09 V with a power dissipation of 100 nW.
  - The sub-BGR circuit generates a reference voltage of 0.548 V with a power dissipation of 52.5 nW.
  - The circuits are designed for nanowatt power LSIs and avoid the use of resistors, using only MOSFETs and one bipolar transistor.
  - The architecture includes a nano-ampere current reference circuit, a bipolar transistor, and proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) voltage generators.

- **Architecture**:
  - The BGR and sub-BGR circuits are implemented without resistors, which allows them to operate at sub-1-V supply voltages.
  - The circuits use a PTAT voltage generator to compensate for the negative temperature dependence of the base-emitter voltage in a PNP bipolar transistor.

### From the [2] reference titled "A CMOS bandgap and sub-bandgap voltage reference circuits for nanowatt power LSIs":
- **Specifications**:
  - The BGR circuit generates a bandgap voltage of 1.18 V with a standard deviation of 19.1 mV.
  - The sub-BGR circuit generates a sub-bandgap voltage of 553 mV with a standard deviation of 9.0 mV.
  - The line regulations for the BGR and sub-BGR circuits are 0.45%/V and 0.11%/V, respectively.

- **Architecture**:
  - The BGR circuit consists of a nano-ampere current reference, a bipolar transistor, and a PTAT voltage generator.
  - The PTAT voltage generator uses source-coupled differential pairs to generate a positive temperature-dependent voltage.
  - The architecture is designed to operate without resistors, similar to the main paper, focusing on nanowatt power operation.

### Comparison:
- Both papers focus on designing BGR and sub-BGR circuits for nanowatt power LSIs without using resistors, which is a key feature for low-power operation.
- The main paper provides specific power dissipation values (100 nW and 52.5 nW) and reference voltages (1.09 V and 0.548 V), while the [2] reference provides slightly different reference voltages (1.18 V and 553 mV) and includes standard deviation values, indicating a focus on variability and precision.
- The architecture in both papers includes a PTAT voltage generator and a bipolar transistor, but the [2] reference provides more detail on the use of source-coupled differential pairs in the PTAT voltage generator.

Overall, both documents present similar approaches to designing low-power BGR and sub-BGR circuits, with slight variations in specifications and additional details in the [2] reference regarding the implementation of the PTAT voltage generator.
