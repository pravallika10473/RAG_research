INTRODUCTION\nTHE development of nanowatt LSIs is expected to lead to\nthe expansion of next-generation power-aware applica-\ntions such as life-log and life-a ssist medical devices, environ-\nmental sensor s, and wireless sensor networks [1], [2]. Because\nthey must operate for a long time with less-than-ideal energy\nsupply from microbatteries or from surrounding natural energy,\nwe need to de sign LSIs that operate with extremely low power\ndissipation. To develop such LSIs, we must ﬁrst develop voltage\nreference circuits because they are one of the most fundamental\nanalog b uilding circuits. Here, we desc ribe process, voltage, and\ntemperature (PVT) variation-tolerant voltage reference circuits\nthat can operate at several tens of nanowatts or less.\nBandgap reference (BGR) circuits are widely used in modern\nLSIs to generate a reference vol tage on chips. The generated\nvoltage is used for various analog signal processes. Although\nseveral BGRs have been developed, the power dissipations of\nmost of them exceed nanowatt power [3]–[7] and have not been\nManuscript received September 04, 2012; revised December 12, 2012;\naccepted March 02, 2013.

One reason for this is the use of resistors.\nThe resistors in most reference circuits are used to generate cur-\nrent or voltage to control the temp erature characteristics of the\noutput reference voltage [3]–[9]. When we use a moderate valuefor resistance, suf ﬁcient current for the resistors is required and\npower dissipation therefore cannot be reduced. Although it can\nbe reduced if we accept using a large value for resistance, theresistors will occupy a large area of the silicon.\nResistor-less voltage reference circuits that operate at\nnanowatt power have been reported [10]–[12]. However, be-cause the output reference voltages of these circuits are based\non the threshold voltage of MOSFETs, the voltages will change\nwith process variations [10]–[12]. Therefore, they are notsuitable for use as voltage reference circuits.\nThis paper presents a nanowatt BGR circuit that does not use\nresistors [13]. In contrast to Hirose et al. [ 1 3 ] ,w eu s ead i f f e r e n t\n0.18-\nm CMOS process to demonstrate the robustness of our\nBGR circuit architecture. Th e proposed BGR consists of a\nnano-ampere current reference c ircuit, a bipolar transistor, and\nproportional-to-absolute-tem perature (PTAT) voltage gener-\nators. Because the circuit on ly consists of MOSFETs except\nfor the bipolar transistor, it can generate a bandgap voltagewithout resistors. In addition, a s ub-BGR circuit that generates\nvoltage lower than 1.2 V is also presented. The proposed\nsub-BGR uses a voltage divider. The voltage divider acceptsthe base-emitter voltage of the b ipolar transistor and generates\na sub-1-V reference voltage in combination with the PTAT\nvoltage generators. Therefore, the proposed sub-BGR is usefulas a reference circuit in sub-1-V LSIs.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the op-\nerating principles behind our proposed circuits. Section III de-scribes the implementation of the circuits using 0.18-\nmC M O S\nprocess technology with deep N-well option and presents the\nexperimental results with a fab ricated proof-of-concept chip.\nExtremely low power dissipation of 100 nW for the BGR and\n52.5 nW for the sub-BGR were achieved.

BGR\nFig. 1 shows the architecture of the proposed BGR circuit.\nIt consists of a nano-ampere curr ent reference circuit, a bipolar\ntransistor, and a PTAT voltage generator. The operating princi-ples of the circuits are as follows.\nPTAT voltage in conventional B GR circuits is generated\nby using bipolar transistors a nd resistors. However, as we\nexplained in the previous section, it is not advantageous to useresistors at nano-ampere curren t levels. Fig. 2 shows the PTAT\nvoltage generator we used [8], [13]. It consists of a differentialpair with a current mirror.

Fig. 3 is a schematicof a nano-ampere a current reference circuit (no start-up circuitis shown) we used [15]. The circuit consists of a bias voltagecircuit, the PTAT voltage generator, and a current source cir-cuit. All MOSFETs operate in the subthreshold region exceptfor the MOS resistor\nthat operates in the strong-inver-\nsion and deep triode regions.

Because has\na negative dependence on temperature, the PTAT voltage gen-erator is used to cancel out this d ependence. As (5) is approxi-\nm a t e db yt h e ﬁrst order,\nhas higher order dependencies on\ntemperature. Therefore, there w ill be nonlinearities in the output\nvoltage even though we cancel out the negative dependence of\non temperature. However, th e nonlinearities can be com-\npensated for if we use a technique of curvature compensationsuch as that reported by Ge et al. [5]. The bias current of the\nbipolar transistor also determines the accuracy of\n. Because\nbias current is generated from th e current reference circuit and\nthe generated current is tolerant t o threshold voltage variations,\nthe current variations can be mini mized [15]. Therefore, the ef-\nfect of bias current variations can also be minimized.\nThe PTAT voltage generator in Fig. 2 supplies voltage\nwhich has a positive dependence on temperature as discussedpreviously. However, because\nin (2)\nis included in a logarithmic function, it must have a largevalue (\n40 M) in order for the positive temperature coef ﬁcient\nof to cancel out the negative temperature dependence\n(2m V / C) of base-emitter voltage . Moreover, making\nmuch larger than requires a large area\nand this cannot be made use of. We use a number of differentialpairs and cascade them to obtain suf ﬁcient PTAT voltage.\nWhen the differential pairs ar e connected in a cascade, total\ngate-to-gate voltage\ncan be expressed as\n(6)\nwhere is the number of differential pairs. Because the ra-\ntios of are multiplied, large PTAT\nvoltage can be ef ﬁciently obtained from (6).Output reference voltage in the bandgap voltage ref-\nerence circuit can be expressed from (5) and (6) as\n(7)\nTherefore, the condition can be obtained by\nappropriate choice of the aspect ratios of the transistors in thedifferential pairs and current mirrors, and of\n.\nC. Sub-BGR\nBecause the bandgap voltage of silicon is larger than 1.2 V,\nBGR circuits require more than 1.2 V of supply voltage. Here,we present a voltage reference circuit that operates at sub-1-Vpower supply.\nFig. 4 shows a block diagram of the proposed sub-BGR cir-\ncuit. The circuit uses a voltage divider circuit. The voltage di-vider circuit divides the base-emitter voltage\n. The output\nvoltage of the voltage divider can be expressed as\n(8)\nwhere is the division ratio of the divider. Then, the PTAT\nvoltage generator is also used to cancel the negative dependenceon temperature of\n. The reference output voltage\nof this circuit is expressed as\n(9)\nwhere is the number of differential pairs. Note that because\nbase-emitter voltage is divided by , the negative temper-\nature coef ﬁcient is also divided by . Therefore, the required\nPTAT voltage decreases and the number of differential pairs canbe reduced. As a result, both the ar ea and the current dissipation\nin the sub-BGR circuit are less than those in the BGR circuit.\nA zero temperature coef ﬁcient voltage is obtained in a similar\nway to that of the BGR circuit by designing the aspect ratios so\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: The University of Utah.

Circuit Implementation\nWe fabricated a proof-of-concept chip using a 0.18- m,\n1-poly, 6-metal CMOS process with deep N-well option.Figs. 5 and 6 show the schematics for the proposed BGR andsub-BGR circuits. A cascode con ﬁguration was used in the\ncircuits to reduce dependence on supply voltage. All transistorsizes are provided in Figs. 5 and 6. We determined the transistorsizes based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations assuming\nboth die-to-die (D2D) and within-die (WID) variations intransistor parameters [16]–[18].\nFive differential pairs were used in the BGR in this design.\nThe reference output voltage\nof this circuit can be ex-\npressed as\n(11)\nA zero temperature coef ﬁcient voltage can be obtained by de-\nsigning the aspect ratios in the differential pairs and the currentmirrors so that the second term in (11) becomes zero.\nWe used a source-follower circu it as a voltage divider circuit\nin the sub-BGR.

An on-chip decoupling capacitor willreduce noise. However, it may degrade start-up time. There-fore, the decoupling capacitor s hould be designed to satisfy\nthe required noise accuracy an d start-up time depending on\napplications. The circuits for driving capabilities should notbe directly connected to resistive loads because of their poordriving current. Bias current in the last stage of the PTATgenerators should be increased if we have to drive resistiveloads and/or large capacitive lo ads. However, the increase in\nbias current leads to high power dissipation. We have to design\nbias current in accordan ce with applications.\nTable I summarizes the perfo rmance of the proposed BGR\nand sub-BGR circuits and compares them with other reportedreference voltage circuits [3]– [13]. The proposed circuits op-\nerate with ultralow power dissipation. The minimum supplyvoltage of the sub-BGR is especially low at 0.7 V.\nC. Discussion\nThe coef ﬁcients of variation in the ex perimental results were\nvery small because the nine samples were obtained from thesame wafer. In order to evaluate robustness to process varia-tions, we performed Monte Carlo SPICE simulations. The re-sults for 500 runs are depicted in Fig. 14. The coef ﬁcients of\nvariation for\nand were 0.351% and 1.61%, re-\nspectively. It was reported to be 7% in [11]. Thus, our pro-posed circuit is superior in process variations. The improvementcomes from the fact that our pro posed circuit is based on not the\nthreshold voltage of MOSFETs, but the bandgap voltage of thesilicon.\nOutput voltage\n, 1.09 V, in the experimental results\nwas lower than the material bandgap voltage, around 1.2 V.This was because the operating current increases with tempera-ture.

The\nmeasured biased with the current and their linear ﬁtting\ncurves were also shown in the ﬁgure. When the bipolar transistor\naccepts the constant currents, s at absolute zero temperature\nwere almost equal to the material bandgap voltage ( 1.2 V).

They consist of a nano-ampere current refer-ence circuit, a bipolar transistor, and PTAT voltage generators.Because the circuits only con sist of MOSFETs except for the\nbipolar transistor, they generat e reference voltages without re-\nsistors.

INTRODUCTION\nTHE development of nanowatt LSIs is expected to lead to\nthe expansion of next-generation power-aware applica-\ntions such as life-log and life-a ssist medical devices, environ-\nmental sensor s, and wireless sensor networks [1], [2]. Because\nthey must operate for a long time with less-than-ideal energy\nsupply from microbatteries or from surrounding natural energy,\nwe need to de sign LSIs that operate with extremely low power\ndissipation. To develop such LSIs, we must ﬁrst develop voltage\nreference circuits because they are one of the most fundamental\nanalog b uilding circuits. Here, we desc ribe process, voltage, and\ntemperature (PVT) variation-tolerant voltage reference circuits\nthat can operate at several tens of nanowatts or less.\nBandgap reference (BGR) circuits are widely used in modern\nLSIs to generate a reference vol tage on chips. The generated\nvoltage is used for various analog signal processes. Although\nseveral BGRs have been developed, the power dissipations of\nmost of them exceed nanowatt power [3]–[7] and have not been\nManuscript received September 04, 2012; revised December 12, 2012;\naccepted March 02, 2013.

One reason for this is the use of resistors.\nThe resistors in most reference circuits are used to generate cur-\nrent or voltage to control the temp erature characteristics of the\noutput reference voltage [3]–[9]. When we use a moderate valuefor resistance, suf ﬁcient current for the resistors is required and\npower dissipation therefore cannot be reduced. Although it can\nbe reduced if we accept using a large value for resistance, theresistors will occupy a large area of the silicon.\nResistor-less voltage reference circuits that operate at\nnanowatt power have been reported [10]–[12]. However, be-cause the output reference voltages of these circuits are based\non the threshold voltage of MOSFETs, the voltages will change\nwith process variations [10]–[12]. Therefore, they are notsuitable for use as voltage reference circuits.\nThis paper presents a nanowatt BGR circuit that does not use\nresistors [13]. In contrast to Hirose et al. [ 1 3 ] ,w eu s ead i f f e r e n t\n0.18-\nm CMOS process to demonstrate the robustness of our\nBGR circuit architecture. Th e proposed BGR consists of a\nnano-ampere current reference c ircuit, a bipolar transistor, and\nproportional-to-absolute-tem perature (PTAT) voltage gener-\nators. Because the circuit on ly consists of MOSFETs except\nfor the bipolar transistor, it can generate a bandgap voltagewithout resistors. In addition, a s ub-BGR circuit that generates\nvoltage lower than 1.2 V is also presented. The proposed\nsub-BGR uses a voltage divider. The voltage divider acceptsthe base-emitter voltage of the b ipolar transistor and generates\na sub-1-V reference voltage in combination with the PTAT\nvoltage generators. Therefore, the proposed sub-BGR is usefulas a reference circuit in sub-1-V LSIs.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the op-\nerating principles behind our proposed circuits. Section III de-scribes the implementation of the circuits using 0.18-\nmC M O S\nprocess technology with deep N-well option and presents the\nexperimental results with a fab ricated proof-of-concept chip.\nExtremely low power dissipation of 100 nW for the BGR and\n52.5 nW for the sub-BGR were achieved.

An on-chip decoupling capacitor willreduce noise. However, it may degrade start-up time. There-fore, the decoupling capacitor s hould be designed to satisfy\nthe required noise accuracy an d start-up time depending on\napplications. The circuits for driving capabilities should notbe directly connected to resistive loads because of their poordriving current. Bias current in the last stage of the PTATgenerators should be increased if we have to drive resistiveloads and/or large capacitive lo ads. However, the increase in\nbias current leads to high power dissipation. We have to design\nbias current in accordan ce with applications.\nTable I summarizes the perfo rmance of the proposed BGR\nand sub-BGR circuits and compares them with other reportedreference voltage circuits [3]– [13]. The proposed circuits op-\nerate with ultralow power dissipation. The minimum supplyvoltage of the sub-BGR is especially low at 0.7 V.\nC. Discussion\nThe coef ﬁcients of variation in the ex perimental results were\nvery small because the nine samples were obtained from thesame wafer. In order to evaluate robustness to process varia-tions, we performed Monte Carlo SPICE simulations. The re-sults for 500 runs are depicted in Fig. 14. The coef ﬁcients of\nvariation for\nand were 0.351% and 1.61%, re-\nspectively. It was reported to be 7% in [11]. Thus, our pro-posed circuit is superior in process variations. The improvementcomes from the fact that our pro posed circuit is based on not the\nthreshold voltage of MOSFETs, but the bandgap voltage of thesilicon.\nOutput voltage\n, 1.09 V, in the experimental results\nwas lower than the material bandgap voltage, around 1.2 V.This was because the operating current increases with tempera-ture.

The\nmeasured biased with the current and their linear ﬁtting\ncurves were also shown in the ﬁgure. When the bipolar transistor\naccepts the constant currents, s at absolute zero temperature\nwere almost equal to the material bandgap voltage ( 1.2 V).

Because the sub-BGR circ uit divides the output voltage\nof the bipolar transistor, it can operate at sub-1-V power supply.The experimental results dem onstrated that the BGR circuitcould generate a reference voltage of 1.09 V and the sub-BGR\ncircuit could generate one of 0.548 V.

Paul Brokaw , Life Fellow, IEEE , and\nT. R. Viswanathan , Fellow, IEEE\nAbstract— This paper describes a bandgap reference that out-\nputs a fraction of the silicon bandgap voltage. To simplify thedesign of an internal operational ampliﬁer, the reference drivesthe base voltages on substrate\ntransistors through unity-gain\nbuffers to a fraction of a diode drop. With a 1.4 V supply, thereference produces an output of about 858 mV , which variesby 1.28 mV from\n20\nC to 100\n C. It dissipates 162\n W and\noccupies 1.2 mm/50in 0.35\n m CMOS.\nIndex Terms— Analog circuits, analog integrated circuits, CMOS\nanalog integrated circuits, reference circuits, temperature.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nSHRINKING device dimensions in advancing CMOS tech-\nnologies require lower supply voltages to ensure device\nreliability. As a result, analog circuit designers are faced with\nmany challenges in ﬁnding new ways to build analog circuits\nthat can operate at lower supply voltages while maintainingperformance. Bandgap references are subject to these head-room problems especially when the required supply voltage\napproaches the bandgap voltage of silicon [1], [2]. To overcome\nthis problem, references that output a fraction of the bandgapvoltage have been demonstrated [3], [4]. However, the coresof such references require operational ampliﬁers (opamps)\nthat must properly operate with a common-mode input voltage\nof one diode drop, which falls with increasing temperature.This requirement can be met with CMOS technologies usinglow-threshold devices [3] and with BiCMOS technologies\n[4], [5]. Also, standard CMOS technologies can work using\ntransistors in weak inversion [6], [7] as well as using an opampwith internal level shifting [6], [8]. This paper describes a pureCMOS solution that drives the base voltages on substrate\ntransistors through unity-gain buffers to a fraction of a diodedrop. This structure simpliﬁes the opamp design by raising itscommon-mode input voltage and allows the use of standardCMOS transistors biased in strong inversion at low supply\nvoltages [9].\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the\nmain circuits; Section III describes the frequency compensa-tion, and Section IV describes the trimming. The measured re-\nsults are presented in Section V, and the conclusion is given in\nSection VI.\nManuscript received November 3, 2006; revised April 7, 2007.

To sink these base currents, two\nlow output-impedance unity-gain buffers are used in Fig. 1. Akey challenge is to design these buffers as well as the opamp inFig. 1 to have small offset voltages, allowing the circuit to op-\nerate as described above.\nFig. 2 shows the buffer schematic [10]. The input and output\nvoltages to ground are\nand\n , respectively. Transistors\nand\n along with resistor\n form a two-stage ampli ﬁer\nconnected in unity-gain feedback. Transistors\n form\na self-bias loop for the ﬁrst stage that is controlled by the load\ncurrent ﬂowing in the second stage. At ﬁrst, assume\n is off.\nNegative feedback adjusts the voltage from the gate of\n to\nground to pull the correct amount of current to set\n ,\nconﬁrming the assumption that\n is off. This adjustment\nalso couples to the gate of\n , providing feedback current to\nself-bias the ﬁrst stage of the buffer through\n and\n . Tran-\nsistors\n ,\n and\n are identically sized with equal drain\ncurrents, which makes\n assuming no\ntransistor mismatch. Therefore,\n , removing sys-\ntematic offset in the current mirror of the ﬁrst stage and leading\nto a reduced overall offset in the buffer independent of the tem-\nperature-dependent base current that the buffer must sink.\nSince the buffers are self-biased, each buffer requires a\nstart-up circuit to ensure proper operation. The start-up circuit\nshown here is drawn with thin lines and consists of\n . The\ngate of\n is connected to the buffer output, and the source is\nconnected to the buffer input, which is connected through either\nor\n to ground in Fig. 1. If the transistors in the self-bias\nloop are off, then the drain current in\n is zero. As a result,\nFig. 3. Opamp schematic.\nthe buffer output is pulled up through\n until the gate-source\nvoltage of\n is enough to turn it on. When\n is on, it\npulls down on the gate of\n , providing bias current to the ﬁrst\nstage of the buffer. As the ﬁrst stage of the buffer self-biases,\nnegative feedback in the buffer starts adjusting the gate of\nto sink current, reducing the buffer output voltage. Eventually,\nin Fig. 2 and\n turns off, allowing the circuit to\noperate as described above.\nFig. 3 shows the schematic of the opamp in Fig. 1.

Since\n and\nappear in both inequalities, the minimum required\n is set by\nthe larger of\n and\n . In the prototype,\nthe magnitude of\n -channel threshold voltages (about 0.75 V) is\ngreater than that of\n -channel transistors (about 0.55 V); how-\never, the body effect increases the threshold of\n but not of\n. In practice, both constraints are important over variations\nin process and temperature. Furthermore, decreasing the mag-nitudes of the threshold voltages of both\n- and\n -channel tran-\nsistors in more advanced CMOS technologies reduces the min-\nimum required power-supply voltage of the reference.\nThe main start-up circuit is shown with thin lines in Fig. 1.\nIt consists of pull-down transistor\n whose drain connects to\nthe output of the opamp\n . The gate of\n is controlled by\nan inverter, which consists of\n and\n . The gate of\n is\ncontrolled by the non-inverting input on the opamp\n . If the\nbandgap circuit does not start up when the power supply rampsup,\nremains below about 0.5 V. As a result,\n would be\noff and\n turns on, pulling\n down, which turns on the\nopamp and\n . When\n becomes large enough to\nturn on\n , the gate of\n is pulled down so that it turns off\nand disconnects from the rest of the circuit.\nIII. F REQUENCY COMPENSATION\nCapacitor\n in Fig. 1 creates the dominant low-frequency\npole in the global feedback loop and in the opamp self-bias loop.\nThe dominant pole is close to 1 Hz, which means the pole in-troduces roughly 90\nof phase shift above about 10 Hz, leaving\nless than 90\n of phase that the rest of the circuit can contribute\nbefore becoming unstable. To limit the extra phase shift intro-\nduced by the buffers at high frequencies, the bandwidth of thebuffers must be high. As a result, the buffer compensation is dif-ﬁcult, as explained below.\nThe buffer shown in Fig. 2 uses both negative feedback (NFB)\nand positive feedback (PFB). The NFB loop sets the outputvoltage equal to the input voltage and includes\n,\n ,\n, and the connection from from the buffer output to the gate\nof\n . The PFB loop self-biases the ﬁrst stage and includes\n. Miller compensation from the gate to the drain of\nis not used to avoid introducing a right-half-plane zero [11],\n[12]. Instead, compensation capacitor\n is placed at the high-\nimpedance output node of the ﬁrst stage of the buffer to compen-\nsate both loops. The required size of\n is largely determined\nby the compensation needs of the PFB loop, which is stronglyaffected by the parasitic capacitance from the gates of current\nmirror\nto ground.\nTo explain the effect of this parasitic capacitance on the com-\npensation needs, Fig. 4(a) models a portion of the PFB self-biasloop. Let\nrepresent the small-signal variation in the drain cur-\nrent of\n stemming from the PFB loop. Also, let\n repre-\nsent corresponding small-signal variation in the voltage fromthe output of the ﬁrst stage of the buffer to ground. Then the\nPFB loop gain is proportional to\n. The parasitic capaci-\ntance from the gates of\n to ground is represented by\n. For simplicity, assume that the small-signal output resis-\ntances of\n and\n are in ﬁnite. Then\n and\n push in-\ncremental currents of\n into\n and\n . Since\n is diode\nFig. 4. (a) Buffer compensation model. (b) Frequency response.\nconnected, a small-signal resistance of\n appears in par-\nallel with the output resistance of\n and\n from the\ngate of\n to ground. From this impedance and the current in-\njected by\n , the small-signal gate-source voltage of\n can\nbe calculated as\n(8)\nThis voltage then controls the voltage-controlled current source\nin the model for\n .

Trim circuitry. /77\n and /77\n from Fig. 1 are shown with light lines for\norientation.\nThe magnitude of\n is plotted in Fig. 4(b). At low fre-\nquencies, the current mirror copies almost all of\n to the drain\nof\n , essentially canceling the current injected by\n . On the\nother hand, at high frequencies,\n shorts out the gate of\n ,\nreducing the current copied to the output of the mirror. Since the\ncurrent from\n continues to ﬂow at high frequencies, however,\nincreases as the impedance of\n falls until the current\ncopied to the output of the current mirror is insigni ﬁcant com-\npared to the current being pushed down by\n . As a result,\ncontributes both a zero and a pole to the PFB loop. The zero re-\nduces the stability of the PFB loop by increasing the loop gain.Capacitor\nin Fig. 2 must be large enough to reduce the\noutput impedance of the ﬁrst stage in the buffer at a lower fre-\nquency than\n .\nThis analysis shows that increasing\n decreases\n , which\nalso reduces\n , increasing the required\n and decreasing\nthe bandwidth of the buffer. On the other hand, the buffer band-\nwidth can be increased by increasing\n , allowing\n to be\nreduced. This result can be accomplished by reducing the gateareas of\n,\n , and\n to reduce\n . However, decreasing\nthese gate areas increases the random mismatch in the current\nmirror, increasing the random offset voltage of the buffer andworsening the variation in the output of the reference over tem-perature without trimming. Thus, this circuit has a tradeoff be-\ntween its stability and temperature insensitivity.\nIV. T\nRIMMING\nTo minimize the temperature variation of the circuit, the\nPTAT term [\n in (3)] is adjusted by changing the currents\nsupplied by\n and\n to the emitters of\n and\n . Ad-\njustment of the PTAT voltage can also be used to compensate\nfor output variations contributed by buffer and opamp offsets.\nHowever, the required trim range increases with increasingoffsets.\nFig. 5 shows a schematic of the circuitry used to trim the ref-\nerence. To adjust the currents supplied by\nand\n , each of\nthese transistors has an array of corresponding unit devices that\nFig. 6. Die photograph.\nFig. 7. Plot of output voltage versus temperature with trimming at two temper-\natures.\nmay be connected in parallel under digital control. For example,\nhas an array of 64 unit devices controlled by six input bits.\nAny or all of these 64 unit devices can be connected in parallelwith\nto alter its effective width, allowing the current sup-\nplied by\n to be increased by up to about 75%. For\n ,\nnine bits divided into two groups control an array of 512 unitdevices, allowing the current supplied by\nto be increased\nby up to about 150%. To reduce differential nonlinearity errors\nthat could result in missing trim codes, the upper 4 bits of the\ntrim for\n use thermometer-code logic, which produces 16\ncontrol bits. To minimize the temperature sensitivity of the out-puts of the prototypes, about 200 of the 512 trim transistors in\nthe array for\nwere turned on, but none of the 64 trim tran-\nsistors in the array for\n were turned on.\nV.

The output target voltage varies with process forthree main reasons. First, this reference produces a fraction ofthe bandgap voltage controlled by the ratio of two resistors,\nand the resistor matching may change from one process run to\nthe next. Second, the offsets in the opamp and the buffers maychange from one run to the next. Third, the drifts of the offsetswith temperature may change even if the offsets are constant\nbecause threshold and overdrive mismatches have different ef-\nfects on offset drift. As a result, a two-temperature trim is used\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: The University of Utah. Downloaded on September 08,2024 at 16:24:08 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

To simplify thedesign of an internal operational ampliﬁer, the reference drivesthe base voltages on substrate\ntransistors through unity-gain\nbuffers to a fraction of a diode drop.

I NTRODUCTION\nSHRINKING device dimensions in advancing CMOS tech-\nnologies require lower supply voltages to ensure device\nreliability. As a result, analog circuit designers are faced with\nmany challenges in ﬁnding new ways to build analog circuits\nthat can operate at lower supply voltages while maintainingperformance. Bandgap references are subject to these head-room problems especially when the required supply voltage\napproaches the bandgap voltage of silicon [1], [2]. To overcome\nthis problem, references that output a fraction of the bandgapvoltage have been demonstrated [3], [4]. However, the coresof such references require operational ampliﬁers (opamps)\nthat must properly operate with a common-mode input voltage\nof one diode drop, which falls with increasing temperature.This requirement can be met with CMOS technologies usinglow-threshold devices [3] and with BiCMOS technologies\n[4], [5]. Also, standard CMOS technologies can work using\ntransistors in weak inversion [6], [7] as well as using an opampwith internal level shifting [6], [8]. This paper describes a pureCMOS solution that drives the base voltages on substrate\ntransistors through unity-gain buffers to a fraction of a diodedrop. This structure simpliﬁes the opamp design by raising itscommon-mode input voltage and allows the use of standardCMOS transistors biased in strong inversion at low supply\nvoltages [9].\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the\nmain circuits; Section III describes the frequency compensa-tion, and Section IV describes the trimming.

To sink these base currents, two\nlow output-impedance unity-gain buffers are used in Fig. 1. Akey challenge is to design these buffers as well as the opamp inFig. 1 to have small offset voltages, allowing the circuit to op-\nerate as described above.\nFig. 2 shows the buffer schematic [10].

At ﬁrst, assume\n is off.\nNegative feedback adjusts the voltage from the gate of\n to\nground to pull the correct amount of current to set\n ,\nconﬁrming the assumption that\n is off. This adjustment\nalso couples to the gate of\n , providing feedback current to\nself-bias the ﬁrst stage of the buffer through\n and\n .

The start-up circuit\nshown here is drawn with thin lines and consists of\n . The\ngate of\n is connected to the buffer output, and the source is\nconnected to the buffer input, which is connected through either\nor\n to ground in Fig. 1.

Since\n and\nappear in both inequalities, the minimum required\n is set by\nthe larger of\n and\n . In the prototype,\nthe magnitude of\n -channel threshold voltages (about 0.75 V) is\ngreater than that of\n -channel transistors (about 0.55 V); how-\never, the body effect increases the threshold of\n but not of\n. In practice, both constraints are important over variations\nin process and temperature. Furthermore, decreasing the mag-nitudes of the threshold voltages of both\n- and\n -channel tran-\nsistors in more advanced CMOS technologies reduces the min-\nimum required power-supply voltage of the reference.\nThe main start-up circuit is shown with thin lines in Fig. 1.\nIt consists of pull-down transistor\n whose drain connects to\nthe output of the opamp\n .

F REQUENCY COMPENSATION\nCapacitor\n in Fig. 1 creates the dominant low-frequency\npole in the global feedback loop and in the opamp self-bias loop.\nThe dominant pole is close to 1 Hz, which means the pole in-troduces roughly 90\nof phase shift above about 10 Hz, leaving\nless than 90\n of phase that the rest of the circuit can contribute\nbefore becoming unstable. To limit the extra phase shift intro-\nduced by the buffers at high frequencies, the bandwidth of thebuffers must be high. As a result, the buffer compensation is dif-ﬁcult, as explained below.\nThe buffer shown in Fig. 2 uses both negative feedback (NFB)\nand positive feedback (PFB). The NFB loop sets the outputvoltage equal to the input voltage and includes\n,\n ,\n, and the connection from from the buffer output to the gate\nof\n . The PFB loop self-biases the ﬁrst stage and includes\n. Miller compensation from the gate to the drain of\nis not used to avoid introducing a right-half-plane zero [11],\n[12]. Instead, compensation capacitor\n is placed at the high-\nimpedance output node of the ﬁrst stage of the buffer to compen-\nsate both loops. The required size of\n is largely determined\nby the compensation needs of the PFB loop, which is stronglyaffected by the parasitic capacitance from the gates of current\nmirror\nto ground.\nTo explain the effect of this parasitic capacitance on the com-\npensation needs, Fig. 4(a) models a portion of the PFB self-biasloop. Let\nrepresent the small-signal variation in the drain cur-\nrent of\n stemming from the PFB loop. Also, let\n repre-\nsent corresponding small-signal variation in the voltage fromthe output of the ﬁrst stage of the buffer to ground. Then the\nPFB loop gain is proportional to\n.

The output target voltage varies with process forthree main reasons. First, this reference produces a fraction ofthe bandgap voltage controlled by the ratio of two resistors,\nand the resistor matching may change from one process run to\nthe next. Second, the offsets in the opamp and the buffers maychange from one run to the next. Third, the drifts of the offsetswith temperature may change even if the offsets are constant\nbecause threshold and overdrive mismatches have different ef-\nfects on offset drift. As a result, a two-temperature trim is used\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: The University of Utah. Downloaded on September 08,2024 at 16:24:08 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. "

After the two-temperature trim, the variation in the outputvoltage is about 1.3 mV from\n20\nC to 100\n C with a supply\nvoltage of 1.4 V. In practice, however, a one-temperature trim\nis often desired to save both time and money.\nFig. 8 shows a plot of the measured output voltage versus tem-\nperature for 11 references that were trimmed at 25\n C to the av-\nerage output voltage of the two-temperature trimmed reference\nshown in Fig. 7, which was 858 mV. After this one-temperature\ntrim, some references have little variation over temperature, butothers do not work as well.\nFig. 9 shows a histogram of the results for the 11 references\nafter the one-temperature trim. Two references have an output\nFig. 8. Plot of output voltage versus temperature with trimming at one temper-\nature.\nFig. 9. Histogram of results with one-temperature trim.\nFig. 10. Gain from the power supply to the output versus frequency when /86\nvaries by 200 mV peak to peak and has an average value of 1.4 V.\nvariation of less than 2 mV , which is as good or slightly better\nthan the results with two-temperature trimming. Two other ref-\nerences have an output variation of 2 mV to 4 mV , three ref-\nerences give 4 mV to 6 mV variation, three other referencesgive 6 mV to 8 mV variation, and one reference gives 8 mVto 10 mV variation. The variation in the output target voltage\nstems mainly from the output referred random offset contributed\nby the buffers and the opamp.\nFig. 10 shows a plot of the gain from the power supply to the\nreference output versus frequency when\nvaries by 200 mV\npeak to peak and has an average value of 1.4 V. At 100 Hz, the\nmeasured supply gain is\n 68 dB and is limited by the test equip-\nment. The corner of the supply gain resides at about 900 Hz. Thegain from variations on the power supply to the output turns out\nto be small when the gain around the loop is high. As frequency\nincreases, the compensation capacitor\nin Fig. 1 shorts out,\nreducing the loop gain and increasing the power-supply gain.\nA summary of measured performance is shown in Table IV.\nThe power dissipation is 162\n W from a 1.4 V supply. The\noutput noise is 9.1\n V rms from 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz. This refer-\nence gives a measured output voltage variation of 1.28 mV overa temperature range of\n20\nC to 100\n C. This change corre-\nsponds to a global temperature coef ﬁcient of 12.4 ppm/\n C.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: The University of Utah.
