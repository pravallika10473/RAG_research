Question: What's the best circuit design for a low-power bandgap reference?

Thought: I need to first search for available bandgap reference circuits in our database, focusing on low-power designs.

Reasoning:
1. Need to find bandgap reference circuits optimized for low power
2. Should analyze their performance metrics
3. Need to compare different designs
4. Should get the NETLIST for the best design

Action: search_database: low power bandgap reference circuit
PAUSE

Observation: Found 3 relevant designs:
1. BGR_001: 1.2V supply, 100nW power consumption
   - Uses CMOS technology
   - Temperature coefficient: 10ppm/°C
   - Reference voltage: 1.09V

2. BGR_002: 0.7V supply, 52.5nW power consumption
   - Sub-1V operation
   - Temperature coefficient: 15ppm/°C
   - Reference voltage: 0.55V

3. BGR_003: 1.8V supply, 200nW power consumption
   - Traditional architecture
   - Temperature coefficient: 8ppm/°C
   - Reference voltage: 1.2V

Thought: BGR_002 appears most promising for low-power applications. Let me analyze it in detail.

Reasoning for choosing BGR_002:
1. Power Consumption:
   - BGR_002: 52.5nW (lowest)
   - BGR_001: 100nW (1.9x higher)
   - BGR_003: 200nW (3.8x higher)

2. Supply Voltage:
   - BGR_002: 0.7V (lowest)
   - BGR_001: 1.2V (1.7x higher)
   - BGR_003: 1.8V (2.6x higher)

3. Trade-offs:
   - Temperature coefficient is higher (15ppm/°C)
   - But power savings outweigh this for battery-powered applications
   - Sub-1V operation enables use with lower supply voltages
